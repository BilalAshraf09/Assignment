Feature: Login into application
    As a QA
    I Login into application

Scenario: 
    Given I am on the WestwingNow home page
    When I search for "m√∂bel"
    Then I should see product listing page with a list of products
    When I click on wishlist icon of the first found product
    Then I should see the login and registration overlay
    When I switch to login form of the overlay
    And I log in with existing credentials
    Then the product should be added to the wishlist
    And I go to the wishlist page
    And I delete the product from my wishlist
